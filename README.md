# Tamashigo: A Maintenance Manual for a Gamified ToDo App
## Purpose of the Application

Tamashigo is a cross-platform mobile app designed to help university students manage their workload in a fun and engaging way. The app operates as a gamified to-do list, allowing users to input their tasks and the time frames in which they wish to complete them. Tamashigo uses a Tamagotchi-like character that grows and evolves as the user completes tasks, making productivity more rewarding and enjoyable. With Tamashigo, students can easily keep track of their to-do lists, manage their time more effectively, and stay on top of their responsibilities. The app also offers customization options, intuitive task management features, and data visualizations to help students stay motivated and productive.

## Technologies

Tamashigo was developed using a technology stack that includes React Native, Expo, and Firebase. This combination of technologies was chosen for its robustness, scalability, and ease of use in creating cross-platform mobile applications.

  *  React Native: An open-source framework developed by Facebook, React Native allows developers to create cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It offers great performance, a smooth user experience, and simplified maintenance. This technology was selected for Tamashigo to ensure a consistent and high-quality app experience on both iOS and Android devices.

  *  Expo: Expo is a free, open-source platform that simplifies the process of developing, building, and deploying React Native applications. It provides a set of tools and services to streamline development, such as Over-the-Air updates, push notifications, and asset management. By using Expo, the Tamashigo development team was able to accelerate the development process and more easily manage updates and fixes.

*    Firebase: Firebase is a comprehensive backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform developed by Google. It offers a range of cloud-based services and tools, such as real-time databases, authentication, storage, and hosting. Firebase was chosen for Tamashigo to handle backend tasks and provide a scalable infrastructure that can grow with the app's user base.
